Calypso UX
==========

This project is a simple HTML and CSS representation of Calypso. It is used for preparing a full UX plan, and iterating on UX pieces before they are fully implemented.

NOTE: The actual HTML/CSS/JS code is not important in this setup, this is just for working out the design and user experience.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Here's a handy installer for Windows, Mac, and Linux: http://nodejs.org/download/

You should also make sure you have `git` installed, try the `git` command from your terminal, if it's not found then use this installer: http://git-scm.com/download/

### Installing and Running

Clone this git repo to your machine via the terminal using the `git clone` command and then run `grunt` from the root calypso-ux directory.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Automattic/calypso-ux.git
$ cd calypso-ux
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

If you get a `-bash: grunt: command not found` error then run:

```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

The application will run at http://localhost:3000 by default.
